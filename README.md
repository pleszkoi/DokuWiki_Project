# DokuWiki_Project

This project shows how I built a simple, Linux-based Homelab environment. I installed and configured a **DokuWiki system**. My goal was practicing the basics of Linux system administration, configuring a web server and getting to know about security principles. 

## Goals

- Creating a Linux-based Homelab environment
- Using virtualization (VirtualBox)
- Installing and configuring an Apache web server
- Installing a DokuWiki documentation system
- Setting up basic security (firewall, permissions)

## Used Technologies

- Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS
- VirtualBox
- Apache2
- DokuWiki
- UFW
